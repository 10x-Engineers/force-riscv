[Coding style]
Quoted rationale:
"Standardization is Important 

It helps if the standard annoys everyone in some way so everyone feels they are on the same playing field. The proposal here has evolved over many projects, many companies,
and literally a total of many weeks spent arguing. It is no particular person's style and is certainly open to local amendments. "

The FORCE-RISCV project's coding style is largely derived from this coding style guide:
http://www.possibility.com/Cpp/CppCodingStandard.html#names

A more formal coding style guide will be provided very soon, so that contributors can follow the coding style, so that code from everyone has a common style.

We have put together a Python coding standard here: doc/guide/Force_python_coding_guidelines.htm

[Project guide]
Please refer to this file for some insights into developing code for FORCE-RISCV: doc/guide/FORCE_project_guide.html

[Regression]
* Run the main regression while in the force-riscv directory, this should pass fully.
  * ./utils/regression/master_run.py
* Run the unit-tests regression while in the force-riscv directory, this should pass fully.
  *  ./utils/regression/unit_tests.py
